    <h2>Major Football Competitions: The Stages of Glory</h2>
    
    <p>Football competitions are the heartbeat of the sport, providing the stage where legends are born and history is written. These tournaments range from global spectacles involving nations to elite club competitions that showcase the highest level of tactical play.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box" style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #1565c0; margin: 20px 0;">
        <h3>The Pinnacle: International Tournaments</h3>
        <p>National team competitions represent the highest honor a player can achieve, playing for their country's pride.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FIFA World Cup:</strong> Established in 1930, it is the most-watched sporting event on Earth. Held every four years, it determines the world champion among nations.</li>
            <li><strong>UEFA European Championship (The Euros):</strong> Featuring Europe's top nations, this tournament is often considered nearly as difficult to win as the World Cup due to the concentration of elite teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Copa América:</strong> The oldest international continental football competition, featuring the powerhouse nations of South America like Brazil and Argentina.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Elite Club Football</h2>
    <p>Club football is played year-round and represents the commercial and technical peak of the sport. These competitions are divided into domestic leagues and continental "Super" leagues.</p>

    <h3>UEFA Champions League</h3>
    <p>The Champions League is the most prestigious club trophy in the world. It brings together the top-ranked teams from European leagues (like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City). The "Anthem" and the iconic "Starball" logo have become symbols of football excellence.</p>

    <h3>The "Big Five" Domestic Leagues</h3>
    <p>Most football fans follow one of the major European leagues, known for their history and star-studded rosters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>English Premier League:</strong> Known for its intensity, global broadcast reach, and immense financial power.</li>
        <li><strong>La Liga (Spain):</strong> Famous for technical brilliance and the historic "El Clásico" rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona.</li>
        <li><strong>Bundesliga (Germany):</strong> Celebrated for high fan attendance, safe standing sections, and fast, attacking football.</li>
        <li><strong>Serie A (Italy):</strong> Historically known for tactical mastery and world-class defending.</li>
        <li><strong>Ligue 1 (France):</strong> A league known for producing incredible young talent and world-class superstars.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h3>The Domestic Cup Tradition</h3>
    <p>In addition to league play, most countries host "Knockout" cups, such as the <strong>FA Cup</strong> in England. These are unique because they allow tiny, amateur "underdog" teams to play against billion-dollar professional giants, leading to the famous "Giant Killings" that fans love.</p>

    <h2>The Evolution of Women's Competitions</h2>
    <p>The <strong>FIFA Women's World Cup</strong> and the <strong>Women's Champions League</strong> have seen explosive growth in recent years. With record-breaking stadium attendances and rising professional standards, these competitions are redefining the global landscape of the sport.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Summary of Competition Formats</h3>
    <p>Most football competitions follow one of two formats: <strong>League Format</strong> (where every team plays each other and points are totaled over a season) or <strong>Tournament Format</strong> (which uses a "Group Stage" followed by "Knockout Rounds" where the loser is eliminated immediately).</p>

    <h2>Football: History, Evolution, and Global Legacy</h2>
    
    <p>Football is more than just a sport — it is a cultural phenomenon that has shaped societies and inspired nations. While "football" can mean different things globally, it generally refers to team sports where a ball is advanced primarily by kicking and strategic movement.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box" style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #1a3c15; margin: 20px 0;">
        <h3>Ancient Origins</h3>
        <p>The roots of the game reach back thousands of years across various civilizations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cuju (China):</strong> Military texts from the Han Dynasty describe kicking a leather ball through a small opening.</li>
            <li><strong>Kemari (Japan):</strong> An early Japanese game involving foot skills and ball control.</li>
            <li><strong>Mesoamerica:</strong> Traditional games used rubber balls long before modern rules existed.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The Birth of Modern Football</h2>
    <p>The modern game of <strong>Association Football</strong> originated in 19th-century England. Before this, "mob football" was chaotic and often violent. The turning point came in <strong>1863</strong>, when the Football Association (FA) was formed in London to codify the first standardized rules.</p>
    
    <p>This unification led to the founding of the Football League in 1888, creating the structure for the professional sport we see today.</p>

    

    <h2>Globalization & Cultural Impact</h2>
    <p>In 1904, <strong>FIFA</strong> was formed in Paris to govern the sport globally. By 1930, the first FIFA World Cup was held in Uruguay, evolving into the world's most-watched sporting event. Today, leagues like the Premier League and La Liga are woven into national identities across the globe.</p>

    <div style="background: #fff8e1; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
        <h3>American Football: A Parallel Path</h3>
        <p>While the rest of the world focused on soccer, American football evolved separately in the U.S. from rugby and soccer roots. Figures like <strong>Walter Camp</strong> introduced the line of scrimmage and the forward pass, creating the "gridiron" style that led to the NFL and the Super Bowl spectacle.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Football Today</h2>
    <p>Whether it is the global appeal of the World Cup or the strategy of the NFL, football reflects social values and community spirit. It remains "The World's Game," fostering unity and inclusion across every continent.</p>
